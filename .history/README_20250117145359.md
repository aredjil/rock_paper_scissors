# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Simulation 

The goal of this code is to simualte the dynamics of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game using replicator dynamics. 

## How to compile the code ? 

This code uses [`Petsc`](https://petsc.org/release/install/) for solving the ODE system that describes the dynamics of the game. Visulizations are done with `Python`. To compile the project `cd src`, then `make`, this will produce a binary excutable `main.x`, run it with `./mainn`
