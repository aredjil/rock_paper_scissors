# Rock Paper Scissors Game 

This code contains `Petsc` Code to simulate the replicator dynamics of a three players game theory by solving the associated ODEs. 

Compile the code from `src`, `make ` then run the code `./main.x -ts_monitor_lg_solution` to view the dynamics of `p1, p2, p3`, the default payoff matrix corresponds to the rock-paper-scissors
